# Spotify Developer project

This repository is a compilation of fun personal exploration of the Spotify API

## 1. First project: exploration of collaborative playlist
Haven't you always wondered who contributed the most to your collaborative playlist?

How to run:

```

**Technologies used**: Spotipy, Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly

## 2. Second project: Spotify playlist recommender

> <b>:warning: **<font color='orange'>WIP:</font></b>** Idea for a future project, find among spotify curated playlists the one that best matches your mood (i.e. recently played songs)
